# hello-world
This is my second repository. But I made this one to get a better feel for the system.

Hello, 
  I started learning to code back in 2012, but recently I guess you could say I've jumped into the deep end. I love the feeling of loosing hours, or sometimes days, to writing up a project. I love it so much that, within the last year, I have taught myself python, C, ruby, html, css, Javascript, and a little bit of Ruby on Rails and in my mind that is just the beginning. So, that being said; Hello programming world. Here I come.
